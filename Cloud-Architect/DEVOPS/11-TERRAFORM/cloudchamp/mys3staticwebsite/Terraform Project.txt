                                               Terraform Project



1.	Create a file named "provider.tf" with "aws" as provider (Obtain code from 	['https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs']). Now  perform ['terraform init'] command.

2. 	create a file named "main.tf" with creating a s3 bucket (Obtain code from 	['https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/s3_bucket.html']).

3. 	create a file named "variables.tf" by setting bucket name as 'myterraformprojectwebsite2024'.And run the command 	['terraform plan'].

4.	Now run the command ['terraform apply -auto-approve'].

5.	Now add "aws_s3_ownership_controls" code from 	["https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/s3_bucket_ownership_controls"]

6.	To make it public we need to add "public_accress_block" resource(Obtain code from 	['https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/s3_bucket_public_access_block']).

7.	After making the changes in the code again run the command ['terraform plan'].

8.	Now add another resource "s3_bucket_acl" (Obtain code from 	['https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/s3_bucket_acl']).And run ['terraform 	apply -auto-approve'].

9.	Now add another resource "aws_s3_object" (Obtain code from 	['https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/s3_object']).

10.	Now run the command ['terraform apply -auto-approve']

11.	Now add another resource "aws_s3_website_configuration". (Obtain the code from 	['https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/s3_bucket_website_configuration']).

12.	Now run the command ['terraform apply -auto-apply'].

13.	Now the website is ready go to aws console->s3 bucket->bucketname->properties->scroll down->click on link.

14.	for any modifications in html file first perform ['terraform destroy -auto-approve'] command.And after that perform 	['terraform plan'] -> ['terraform apply -auto-approve'].
